Python The Hard Way by Zed A. Shaw (Python 2.7 version)
============================================================================

## Overview

These are the exercises from Python the Hard Way by Zed Shaw. This is a well-taught introduction to Python. It really does a thorough job of explaining syntax, and to some extent, helps the student with good learning discipline. The last few excercises get quite involved, and introduce the idea of unit testing. I didn't complete the final exercise, as didn't want to get the game online.

* I've used venv for the later exercises, where pip is being used to install things
* On OSX, I found that I needed to use `nosetests --exe` to get nose to detect all of the tests
